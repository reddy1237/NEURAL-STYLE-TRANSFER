Overview of the project

Project: NEURAL-STYLE-TRANSFER

Objective

To implement a neural style transfer system that applies artistic styles from reference images to content images, creating visually appealing artworks by blending the content and style seamlessly.

Key Activities

• Data Preparation: Collect and preprocess content and style images.

• Optimization: Iteratively update the content image to minimize the combined loss.

• Model Integration: Implement algorithms for blending content and style features effectively.

• Evaluation: Assess output quality visually or using style transfer metrics.

• Deployment: Create tools or applications for users to upload images and apply artistic styles.

Technology Used

• Image Processing Libraries: OpenCV, PIL (Pillow), or Matplotlib for image manipulation and visualization.

• Optimization Algorithms: Gradient Descent or Adam for iterative image optimization.

• Compute Acceleration: GPUs or TPUs for faster processing of deep learning tasks.

• Deployment Tools: Flask, Streamlit, or Gradio for building user-friendly interfaces.
